          <h2>Who We Are
          </h2>
          <p>
            Bharat Samaj LLC is an Indo-American community-focused for-profit organization with a social purpose—dedicated to creating vibrant community centers for Indo-Americans across the USA. Our aim is to establish Bharat Community Centers across the USA as a one-stop destination for cultural celebration, professional networking, and community growth. Rooted in our rich Indian heritage, we aim to provide a religion-neutral space where culture thrives, and individuals connect and grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Bharat Samaj, we believe in building bridges that unite every corner of the Indo-American community. Our mission is to establish Bharat Community Centers across the USA, creating spaces where families, cultures, and industries come together to celebrate traditions, foster connections, and drive growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            These centers will include spaces for families to interact, host cultural events, and provide resources that cross regional, linguistic, and industry boundaries.
